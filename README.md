# Bamazon-app

This application uses a simple command line storefront using the npm inquirer package and a MySQL database.


Customer Interface
The customer side allows the user to view the current inventory: item IDs, descriptions, departments, price, and the quantity of the items. The user is able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the amound product they wish to purchase. If the amount of product is available, the user is prompted with the total for their order. If the amount of product is NOT available, they are told to modify their order, and shown the inventory again.
